## Data Gathering Suggestions
- Only include Client/Relevant calls: had a few transcripts where the only folks talking where in house names
  - transcripts like `63a074f3a39c8c8e9c0ebe2d.txt` are not really relevant to sales or meaningful client questions, why save them?
- Standardize Names: have a few calls with people like `betty white` or `ben ten` -- unless it makes sense to have specific names for some other function or reason we should anonymize these or treat them in the same manner as `client 1` or `host 1` entries
  - Also had one instance of a weird client name being saved- `'Client 2|Client 2'` in the `637cf23dcc7845331578f507.txt` file, the function for mapping speakers in transcripts should get looked at
