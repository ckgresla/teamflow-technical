       "  \"Client 1: Another thing on the desktop app, for example, if you have the desktop app Open and not the mobile version, even if. You're getting a call back from someone, and it's a number. It will show who the contact is if the contacts in the CRM. But that is another spot that's hit or miss with air call. So instead of, you know, oh, Hello, How's it going, Zack? Right. You're calling me back instead. I'm gonna call from some random number I'm like, oh, man, who's this calling me back? I don't know which person of the 30 people I just called in the last hour. Here we go. Throw the dice. Right. Instead. If you're able to know who they are immediately, you have such a big advantage. Outcome. From that conversation. When someone calls you back, you know who they are, right from the get go.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: As you can't know we have not. We've not looked into power dialers. Personally, I have. So what I mean by that is, is that's not a direction we're gonna take personally? I guess I think it's. Because this is we're not a call center, right person. I think it's a. An interesting concept. I use power dialers before at both my previous sales jobs prior to stupid. One of them at a call center, another one at a small startup where we were working with a lot of leads and contacts, right. I mean, I remember I made 400 calls in a day, once on a power dialer. I remember because it just an insane amount of phone calls. So I see that the efficiency there, like I mentioned, how fast it is to dial. I see the efficiency two of the the dialers that will do the parallel dialing where you can dial multiple numbers at once. Right. Between. Two and five or two in ten contacts at once that you can dial those numbers all at one time. And the moment someone picks up, then the other call, then. So I definitely see the value of those. It depends on your approach and strategy. We like to take a very personalized approach to a collaborative salad. So that's not something we use. But that is the reality of it.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: But we have people on our team saying, oh, well, now they're doing my job. What the heck. Telling them. Well, what do you want. So it's that change management dealing with people that are early on in a careers helping them, you know, catch the vision. Be inspired.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: For call training and coaching, right. I'll review calls with team members. So for example if we determine that. Why they're not booking demos over the phone isn't a matter of how many calls they're making, you know, and their connections, but more so the quality of their calls, their pitches, based on the metrics I have. I'll go ahead and look into that. And we'll listen to their phone calls together. One on one and we'll listen and give, you know, all coach around that and how we could do that better next time. Yeah. It's their opinion on it. And then coach around that. Or we'll use them for training and highlight really good calls that people have. So another another great feature would be to have a call library of sorts that you can save internally in the system, that team members can go and that you can. Okay. This is a call library of really good calls and examples of this specific thing. And you can label those and put folders and put however many calls in those.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: Go ahead. The Company itself. We create. Online resources. We create a two different types. It's called Courseware, which is like an online digital textbook with a turnkey resources for a professor or teacher. So you know all the materials they need to teach the class, lesson plans, the syllabus, the sample schedule, tests, quizzes, teaching notes, all that right. Lecture slides. And then simulations as well. To simulate you know. Marketing. Functions primarily. And we're moving into the business and other spaces as well.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: I believe so. I'm a believer in quality before quantity. My team's. A young team, right? My team. The people on my team. It might be their first sales job, or they might have done summer cells beforehand. It's often the first professional job people have had there's often in school. In College. Right. We're next, right next to local College. So that's why we're at here. We recruit heavily from it. And. For some people, it's their first job, you know, Bar, none. Or their first job outside of fast food.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: I don't even know. I know. When we looked into it, I wasn't, you know, we've been using it for about two years. I was not a part of the decision. I literally jumped in as we're all just after the decision was made to adopt and implement gong.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: I like how it is both on my phone, with the app and on the browser. So if I'm not at work. If you know someone has cold calling or you know, following up on a lead on or you know someone I'm recruiting calls me back. I can take that column, my phone. But being able to call from the browser is faster, right. So that's why I find that efficiency there.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: I mean the the big things I think is. Just. The biggest problem is two counts a growing company. And so there's frequent changes. And so with that it's you know, the people on my team, it's it's hard to see. The long term effects and benefits of a change than a change again in four months on this other topic in that right. So I would say that's probably the biggest obstacle that we have right now. Is trying to help the people on my team have a good perspective on change and change management.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: I mean, I know I can pull the links right to the calls, but again, then we're in Erica, where in this platform with, you know, a Google Doc or Google Drive somewhere. Right. A file with all these links to the calls. And you get to where you're using all the different platforms every which way. If it's centralized, then that makes that simple.\",\n",

       "  \"Client 1: I see some nods. I don't know if you guys are familiar with that, but that was painful. That was painful. So being able to customize that, like a really, really cool thing you could do. Because, like for me, for example, when I'm zeroing in and calling and prospecting and researching, I'll have, like, Spotify up on my phone, for example. Right. I'll listen to music, but I'll be making calls, and so it goes back and forth between my music and the phone call while it's ringing. If you could find a way to. Implement some sort of way to customize the. Playlist or the music that is playing while it's dialing and while you're on hold. Oh, my gosh, you guys would have raving fans. People had flocked to you guys. There's your there's your billion dollar idea. And I just want, like a little small royalty.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: I think it works pretty well, right. There's some things that might be a little. Could be could be different, right there's. I mean as of any product or service, right. They have their different tiers and. Something's cost more or less and so. I think we have the right one for us, but I'm happy to comment. I mean, I come from. I've got other sales companies previous to this, to other companies. We had other dialers or I'm some other features that I see is beneficial or that would be beneficial in a dialer if you're looking at developing one.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: I would say that's the biggest one. The other problems is. There's one of me and we have 16 people on a team, and we're trying to get 24 people. I've got. You know, six more people or so being hired early December, and however many in January, and I anticipate, there's going to be some change. There's only some people promoted out of the team. There'll probably be some people that quit. It's very common around the end of the year and in the end of a semester for our employee based. So. It's just a matter. Hey, there's. There's one of me and 24 of them. So if you can, if you can find a way to clone myself, that would be great.\",\n",

       "  \"Client 1: Let's see. I'm gonna just log into my error call account right now actually to kind of just look at some things. It'll help me just remember some things if that's alright.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: Most people like it. They see it as an improvement from, you know, using their own phone, they like to be able to have that Air call number. It is nice on air call when we're getting a call if you have it on the phone. That it shows up that you're getting a call from Air Call and not just a regular phone call. So that way you might know how to answer the phone. That's another pro you could put down right. But there are some people that you know there's. Depending on how you're calling, if you know you're calling to the web browser and the internet's not great. The call quality might not be good, so call quality, I think, is probably the biggest concern of anyone on my team.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: Not that I know of or not that we're utilizing.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: Oh, wow. And they all try Guys Connection. So it's really hard to track the connections rates when looking at HubSpot in the dashboard we have. That's probably one of my biggest frustrations as director actually. Is as I'm coaching my team and going over that the things that are right. When I it's hard to coach them when I have bad data.\",\n",
       "  'Client 1: On the Web interface.',\n",
       "  \"Client 1: Please. One thing I do like about it is the ability to add, like, local numbers, right. So we could call from a whatever number and a shared number and have everyone have the same number. That's stupid. Or we could call from a local number. So if I'm calling someone in Kansas, I can enable it to show my phone number as a Kansas phone number that we own. Right. And so it might be more likely to pick up the phone if they're getting a call from someone in the same state. What I don't like about that is what I've noticed is with our air call. It can be a little bit obscure when setting up those local numbers. A very very like, for example, we're in Idaho, right. So it might show up as some very, very small, obscure town in Idaho. That's calling. Rather than a more known, you know, area, right. So, for example, like the difference of calling from Rexberg, Idaho versus Boise, Idaho. You guys didn't know Ricksburg was let's you know, and that's anyone in Idaho would know Rexwork. But if we go to, you know, some weird small town of a, you know, a thousand or. 2000 people that's that's most often what we're seeing associate with those local numbers. So that would be an area that could be improved on to.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: Right. So I will. I'll have my pre call planning. Then I preach that to my team to know who they're contacting, be able to have a personalized. Conversation and value proposition to them. And it might sure be a scripted one that they've created, but they tailor it to that individual, right. If you have a power dialer. You can move too fast or parallel dialing. You can absolutely move too fast to be able to have that conversation with someone on a very personal level where you can actually connect with them. And have a collaborative cell. We're able to help them and talk with them in terms of them rather than a pushy cell where it's just sheer, you know, volume of dials and calls and spray and pray.\",\n",
       "  \"Client 1: So I mean, we've changed up some territories. We've changed up. We've added a new role that kind of helps us some other roles. And so a little bit of the role has evolved into, you know, some other things. And so it's it's just a matter of helping people catch the vision of that. We also, you know, the BDR team is intended to drive demos in business. And. Ironically. Half half the you know, however many other group says, oh, well, we're working hardbooking demos. And our account executive just sits and takes the demos and does the demo and that's it. And they just have to wait for them. Right? They just sit there on their hands and wait when they don't have any. Well, now we have an expectation for our account executives that they should also be booking their own demos.

So when I when I'm recruiting. And that right. I use our call for my number that way, not my personal phone number. However, when I'm cold calling side by side with a team, I use the Web experience with the integration and HubSpot right, and the click to dial.\",\n",

They can click to dial. They can also click and dial through an Air call window on the computer right. Depending on their method. If they're using one of the three, it doesn't actually report and track their calls correctly in HubSpot. It double counts their calls. So the way that that's set up is it shows as an inbound call. For most. And it's not even every single phone call. It's it's it's very subjective. Right. So there's no way to actually measure how many calls someone's making if they're doing it that way. I know it's somewhere. Probably between. 50% to 75% of what that number actually shows.\",\n",

As a somewhat of a security risk in some ways for that. So we decided to that we needed to have. A dialing system. So people were just using their own phones. For that. And we could have a consistent number and get calls back. You know, voicemails, text back whatever directed to the right person. So that was the use case of why we wanted to implement Air Call rather than having people use their personal phones for that. There are also some complaints of people that, you know, you're always gonna have those complainers. Oh, they expect me to use my personal phone for this obohu and doesn't cost them anything to do. It really right. It's just something to complain about. So air call. I know we looked at a few. I was somewhat involved with the selection of that. But we had someone who was our director of customer success kind of my counterpart for a customer success team that had come from another company that had experience with Enrique Hall previously.

If they're using one of the three, it doesn't actually report and track their calls correctly in HubSpot. It double counts their calls. So the way that that's set up is it shows as an inbound call.
