Ours actually requires people. So that's what's our differentiator in the marketplace. Is that we actually have very high level high security fire former Nsa folks. Actually going out there and looking for threats. Annual looking at where what our our potential, you know, customers deal threat... you know, threats are that's sort of thing.

Because somebody like... you know, it's... if they don't use it, they lose it. Right? But we do burn hours against those. That aren't Necessarily is responses.

Data in the Salesforce and get a clean, and also from a next perspective we've got a ton of stuff is not in the right, You know, there need to be rec class. The things are that lot of turnover accounting and things aren't coded to the right department. So you know, it'd be the the classic of garbage garbage out. If we actually, you know, it went today so definitely why I take the time to do the data cleanup knob and and whatnot. Yeah. Like, like I said, the the vendors that we looked at last year are kinda, hey, what do you think? And, you know, one of them offered us, you know, a very good deal and we could push the implementation after for three months. Right? So I kinda wanna I wasn't planning on looking at this this quickly. But if... you know, and then our Cfo in some Cfo group.

I think your Erp is nets week. We use Salesforce or Crm, Ekg our Hr. So which try you know, right now, we just download data from all those places. And, you know, couple things we do our budget model we sent out the of the part pack to the our Vps and may put stuff in incorrectly, and then we fix it and then try to make it present and rolling everything together. So run what challenges right now always run version thirty of our budget model. And we we have to slack each other see make sure we're all out of it because we have version control issues and what syncing issues on our on sharepoint.\",\n",
       " \"Client 4: So trying to figure out... And right now, like our business is unique. And that your Typical Saas business you know, customer signs up, you sign a contract. You send a key and they're off and running. With us a challenge is with our software, it requires hardware to be implement... You know, however has to be you put in and then, you know, deployed And then once is deployed that we can start this the the process the software and whatnot. Revenue recognition starts on invoice and we invoice upon deployment know the hardware. So we could sell something in December. And might not deploy so that that we can start... So i'll contact in December So subscription date would be December through November. By a long deploy until May, So we have a mismatch of, you know, the revenue recognition versus subscription.\",\n",

All the second is for reporting.

From a... you know, an I lunch room too big for us. Right Let they go ready for that. Queue, I'm not sure, you know, they had all the functionality we need. So kind of run the gamut of... you know, I don't know what was it it's in on that ladder? Where do you guys position yourself or where are you guys?\",\n",
       " \"Client 4: We wanna have that part, you know, that end in there. We have an another group called Ot Watch, which similar but different. The way their metrics are that certain and you'll great price more certain metrics that we track to, you know, for different utilization components. And then a training team, you know, right now we only have. We have two and a half training. The two trains one part time person And then if we were to blow up the training model, you know, we have ratios of classes to know, people class, and that's right in how often classes kinda want something to build all those, you know, all that nuance in as well. So organization component. Right now, the the model built is revenue based. So, you know, we take the, you know, amount of revenue we plan deliver what utilization is, what the rate is and come out with what we think our capacity is. And then anything where she going short, we, you know, we need more people. I think we wanna change that in all respects to an hour's base thing. Just because like I said, with the the retainer model, we don't necessarily have to burn the revenue. The revenue is going to be recognized evenly across the the subscription. Right? So that the model won't work for that. We wanna kind of look at the hours and hours different our capacity.\",\n",

I again basically, we we definitely wanna get a place where we can model out using the model for, you know, obviously, your actual for a current year for forecast for current year. And then put in our five year plan there as well. Right? A five year growth plan, we want the flexibility to to possibly integrate an acquisition or, you know, acquisition or two during that time frame. So we had like made two sets of books so we you can eventually integrate. What else, like I said, just ways to automate the Reporting, And what the reason we didn't... So we went do this process last year. And the the main reason we didn't do an implementation was because we don't didn't at the time think our data was good. I still don't think it's great. So... And the reason, we'd we'd like to try and look at tell you soon or how to you know, other vendors have reached out again to try to give us, you know, year end pricing. And I I don't wanna rush through the decision to get good pricing.\",\n",

So just here a wait for you look download stop themselves or somebody they to make that process easier. And you know, running reporting that sort thing.

We have a renewal is open, but if it doesn't close at the certain time we combat that churn. There's some ambiguity with regard to you know, when account that is churn. And then the other question, they'll probably have is on our revenue the process was such that either the person is not only here, we're just kinda grouping all of our revenue for a customer in online. And sending invoice where the customer may have a platform subscription an it's response retainer so else, all that was being bucket on online, so really can it's impossible for us to look at like, pull salesforce report four eight given customer product and see if there we're still a recognizing revenue on we don't track things at that level.\",\n",

Well, I'm definitely gonna have a couple people in my team, just watch over this because there is mean, as a big company, obviously, there's a lot of complexity here. And I wanna make sure that when we're showing guys the product, we can tell you what we do well and then also tell you like, hey, here are things that, you know, you guys made still doing spreadsheets. So I wanna i set up the demo, but if I find anything out before that, but you know, there might be some shortcomings from the conversation. I'll let you guys know and that if if it's a deal breaker, know, we can cancel. And if it's not then we'll, you know, Our luxury the tool, because it is super powerful and it is gonna be a lot quicker or time to value than like, you're adaptive. That you're looking at, but I definitely from this conversation think that cube at least is a little bit to lightweight whatever tool just given the complexity guys are mentioning saying.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Oh, of course. It's literally my job, so you don't have to thank me. Thank you.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Oh, wow, nice. I think probably good to know that he didn't respond. I think it was probably our marketing person and not the salesperson and well, looks like Greg is also driving so perfect. We, I think we have the whole... finance aside from your Cfo. Is that right?\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Okay. Awesome. Yeah. That's that's what we saw for.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Okay. Cool. Yeah. We can definitely do the depreciation and whatnot on. It's just not the inventory tracking itself. Nice. And then so Greg, would love sam, like, when you're finding your arr number, what's your starting source truth like, is that nets or is that Salesforce? And then what kind of manipulation you doing to get to that phone number?\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Okay. I'll many reverse you guys have.\",\n",
       " 'Host 1: Plan for Yeah.',\n",
       " \"Host 1: So Yeah. We'll definitely get pricing on the next call. That shouldn't be an issue. We also technically do close our office between Christmas and New Years. But if you need to take call, it's like totally fine. But we'll... I mean, I have some availability on Monday. So if you guys do that probably best. That way we can get a couple calls in before, Greg goes out of office.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: So just gonna be smaller, but it's never gonna entirely go away because you do have that component to.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: So, okay. A couple things that I... Am gonna be very transparent with you guys. They might be blockers here. So let me know. One being local currencies. So because we're pulling in the way that we create our budget, we have a fully integrated through statement model and it creates the cash an indirect method. So because it needs to balance, we can't flip it flop through currencies on the model. We can pull in all the currencies. You guys can actually see on the reporting end. But when you're actually modeling, we can't just like, look at it in Usd and then flip it over to let's say, like, bridge pound or something like that.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: So... Got it. Yeah. Plate adaptive one stream, definitely more like legacy players. I I am curious from your eyes perspective, because you guys are larger as far as like head count and funding size and everything like that. How often are you guys changing the way that you're doing things? Like, are you guys often adding departments adding, you know, potentially looking at training pricing product lines, are you guys acting more as up or is it more enterprise?\",\n",
       " 'Host 1: Sure.',\n",
       " 'Host 1: Talk.',\n",
       " \"Host 1: Totally, I mean, that's the really a whole goal. We're kinda constantly like, innovating on our product and that really is why we're gaining so much market share so quickly is because we started with just give me Sas now we're opening up for our Into a lot more areas. Meant, you like, help you guys get to that you know, Ipo or wherever you guys are are landing.\",\n",
       " 'Host 1: Which part? The inventory tracking? Yeah Okay.',\n",
       " 'Host 1: Yeah.',\n",
       " \"Host 1: Yeah. I actually have a a scheduling link that i'll just send over to you for me and my solutions engineer and then can find.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Yeah. It's a really good question. So I would say prior to the last like, I don't know, four years, it was pretty much a barbell in the get where there's, you know, some lightweight for two plug or still are a lot of them and then there's, like, the Hyper, you know, the active and plan. We're kind of... And this is on purpose, I think. It's just like a gold loss perfect middle round where you do get the flexibility and everything you guys aren't gonna need when you're growing your company, but then you're not having to, like, you know, have this implementation where once you set it up, it's very rigid and you have to have like someone to manage it. I think we definitely have more fun functionality in queue. We are gonna get you guys out of spreadsheets in much of an issue. I think the issues that we see with those more spreadsheet based tools is that a lot of the issues with spreadsheets while they are a little bit better. They're not gone and that you guys are gonna have to continuously build with that. Also, q does have, like, an eight dimension limit limitation which with larger companies like your own is really common that we see that that's a a pretty big limiting factor. But I think you'll you'll quickly see that our approach is very different. From all the other ones in the market.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Yeah. No. That that works out well. Cool. So we'll go through, like, obviously the high level on the tool on our next call, and then we'll definitely wanna scope everything out. As well. So typically we do demo. We do copay, that we like, really dive into any other piece that you guys wanna learn more about. And then happy to to really make this timing work for eyes timing, and and when you guys wanna implement, we do the same thing where it's like, If you guys are ready to make the decision, but you wanna implement later. Start day. It doesn't really matter to us. But that sounds good. So I guess, are there any other... So guys have a little bit of than Nuance in that, you have a large part of your expense being hardware and not all head count based. There anything else that's just a little bit different for your guys's pricing. Like, are you... How do you guys and package product.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Count is different store we can definitely do that. So that's good to hear. And then so as far... Do you guys have, like, It are all of your sources that you're pulling from, Are they the three mentioned, like Ekg nets sweet and Salesforce or is there like a data warehouse is there anything else involved there.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Yeah. So we actually do everything in house. The heavy lifting is on most our part, but definitely is gonna require like, meetings from you guys, a lot of validating a lot of, like, understanding your as data logic. Our typical timeline out is four to six weeks, but for you guys, I'm thinking it honestly might be around double that just given the complexity. So I don't know, eight to eight twelve weeks something like that. Yeah. So it... It's something that we'll scope out further in scoping. But that is our our average.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Yeah. Totally. And so I think that that the reason I asked that question is the adaptive plan full. Those are definitely very robust tools, but pretty much once you go through that really long implementation time. Anytime you wanna change something, it becomes a whole, you know, scoping and consultant type of situation. So that's what Mosaic is meant to avoid is we are meant to be flat for you guys we're if you do need change things or teams like calculation, it's really easy to do that.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Yeah. Yes. Cool. Awesome. We'll love to see it. So I guess wanna open up to you guys and just understand a little bit more about what challenges you're facing a today and, like, really what you're looking for a like, mosaic or any other tools you guys are looking at in the market to solve for.\",\n",
       " \"Host 1: Yeah. You guys actually do fall within. I think it's more the the business model that makes it lot more complex So our sweet spot is... I mean, we do serve series seed customers, but we go up to, like, D e. And then our largest customers like over a thousand employees, but it really... Well depends on how you guys are run in your business rather than, like, you know, the size because it could be more simple and we could serve a lot larger.\",\n",
       " 'Host 1: Yep. Definitely. And so one question I have, are you guys budgeting for op on any dimension to besides department. Are you guys doing anything like by product line or Hardware versus software or anything like that.'}"
